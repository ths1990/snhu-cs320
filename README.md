## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Test early and test often. As new code/functions etc. are written, test to ensure that the code works as it should on it's own as well as test how it interacts with the program as a whole. 
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I review what is being requested from the user and then segment the request into bite-sized requirements. I'll then prioritize the requirements and work through each requirement in order of prioritization. If the needs appear to be unrealistic (ie the tehcnology isn't there, too expensive, etc.), I will push back and offer alternative solutions if available. 
## How do I approach designing software?
I priortize function over form, ensuring that the technical requirements of the software I'm building works to the specification of user needs. I use the resources available to me if I'm having trouble choosing a particular design pattern or experiencing errors.
